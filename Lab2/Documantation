For Lab2:

I will have 2 main components: Symbol Table and Hash Table
Hash Table will be custom:
    - hash: custom hash function for insert
    - add: add to the array with the key hashed
    - get: get an element from the array
    - delete: delete an element from the array

 Symbol table will play like a controller, he will use the hashtable and call the necessary functions from the hasthable
 main includes some tests and calls to symbol table


 For Lab3:

 The main root is ScannerApp, where i will declare A ScannerREsult and compute the result for a txt.
 Declaring the ScannerResult will also declare the Scanner itself and SymbolClassifier
 The Scanner will include the SymbolClassifier and all the conditions that should be checked
 The SymbolClassifier will separete my tokens
