I will have 2 main components: Symbol Table and Hash Table
Hash Table will be custom:
    - hash: custom hash function for insert
    - add: add to the array with the key hashed
    - get: get an element from the array
    - delete: delete an element from the array

 Symbol table will play like a controller, he will use the hashtable and call the necessary functions from the hasthable
 main includes some tests and calls to symbol table
